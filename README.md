**🌟 Introduction**
Predicting house prices is a crucial task in the real estate market. This project aims to create a machine learning model that can accurately predict the price of a house given its features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and more.

**🚀 Features**
Data Exploration: Understand the dataset and identify key features.
Model Development: Build, train, and evaluate different machine learning models.
Visualization: Generate insightful plots to understand the data and model performance.
Prediction: Make predictions on new data to estimate house prices.
**📊 Dataset**
The dataset used in this project includes various features like:

Location: Geographic area where the house is located.
Size: Square footage of the house.
Bedrooms: Number of bedrooms.
Bathrooms: Number of bathrooms.
Year Built: Year the house was constructed.
...and more.
Note: The dataset can be found here or is included in the repository.
